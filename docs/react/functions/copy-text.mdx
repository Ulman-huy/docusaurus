# copyText()

The copyText function you provided is a simple utility function that attempts to copy a given text to the clipboard using the navigator.clipboard.writeText() method. However, there's a slight issue with it: navigator.clipboard.writeText(text) returns a Promise, but you're not handling the result of this Promise in your function.

### Code

```ts title="copyText.ts"
const copyText = async (text: string) => {
  try {
    await navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

### Example

```jsx
copyText("Copy now!");
```
